It seems you want to know more about me? Then you are in the right place ;)
I am currently working at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at the Institute of Flight Systems. My current work evolves around Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA), particularly deep in the Hardware/Software interface side. Here, I focus on how Machine Learning algorithms can be safely integrated into the Avionics of tomorrow from a hardware, performance and safety point of view. This involves dealing with aviation-grade Real-Time Operating Systems, specific hardware architectures (currently mostly ARM-based, but it seems to go towards RISC-V), hardware-based computing accelerators (currently in from of FPGA implementations) and the development process within modern contexts (#CI/CD) and traditional aviation standards regarding safety, security and reliability.
Ending up in this environment has been something like a *happy little accident*. It has given me a lot of insight into the academic and professional world while doing what I do best: Think and solve problems :)
My motto is to try everything at least once. This is particularly true for food, but reflects on all aspects of life: from my hobbies down to the general attitude towards life to experiment (for instance the creation of this website - definitively not perfect, but a place to learn and improve). 
My biggest long-term passion is music, and it stays with me wherever I go. From traditional Bohemian folk music to Jazz to EDM, I will listen to everything, and if it is playable on euphonium/trombone, I more than likely will (at least try to) play it, too. Now I am growing very much interested in darts, bicycling and crafts, particularly with wood. Let's see where this is taking me ;)

Of course, there is more to me than those few lines. If you are interested in getting to know me more, get in touch with me :)
